<h1>Slide in on Scroll</h1>

<p>The masked man crept down the corridor stealthily. It was quite dark in the hallway but he knew that it was a synthetic
darkness, a matter of temporal convenience, for on a spaceship, time is regulated by the Terran daily cycle of
twenty-four hours.</p>

<p>On spacecraft the passenger-sections observe a strict twelve-hour division between sheer brilliance and utter darkness.
He estimated that it was a full two hours before light-time, which meant that those couples who preferred to sit and
hold hands whilst staring at the rather over-stable aspect of the sky were by now bedded down and asleep.
</p>
<p>Even so the masked man understood that with such it was not the sky that was appealing, and that under such
circumstances time was a minor and often disregarded item. So he went carefully just in case he should happen upon such.
</p>
<p>He was lucky. There were no couples immersed in one another's dreams and so the masked man went all the way from the
auxiliary spacelock near the bottom to the "B" deck, just below the rounded hemisphere of seamless plastiglass that
domed the top of the spacecraft.
</p>
<p>He entered the corridor that led to the staterooms and, by the dim hall lights, found the room he sought. The lock was
obviously intended to keep out only honest men and the door was of the same manufacture. He took a tiny
fountain-pen-sized implement from a loop in his belt and applied the business end to the door.
</p>

<p>There was neither sound nor light. Silently the thing worked and it completely removed a sliver ten-thousandths of an
inch wide as he moved the tiny beam in a careless square around the lock. He grasped the knob in his hand as he
completed the cut. That way it would not drop to the floor and make an unwanted racket.

</p>
<p>Shoving the door open gently, he entered and closed it behind him. He took a moment to replace the square of aluminum
with the lock and, with a couple of quick motions, he welded the square back in place.

</p>
<p>An experienced welder would have called the job 'buttering' because the patch was held by only two minute battens of
welded metal. It could be broken out with a single twist of the hand.

</p>

<p>Then, reasonably safe from outside detection—if the steward passed, he would not notice unless he gave each door a
careful scrutiny—the masked man took out a tiny flashlight and searched the room quickly.

<p> A tousled head of luxuriant hair half covered the pillowcase but the face beneath it was not visible from the door. The
masked man shrugged and turned to the wall compartment where the baggage was stored. He knew about where to look. He
fumbled through three drawers, and finally came upon a box of some ten cubic inches.

</p>
<p>It was not too heavy and the masked man tucked it under one arm and smiled confidently. His pen-beam he used to weld the
call-button to its frame so that it could not be pushed. He used it to weld the lock in a barred position and, again
outside, he welded the patch together firmly. The inhabitant was to all intents and purposes a prisoner until she could
command attention by yelling and beating upon the door.

</p>
<p>With the same stealth that he had used in coming this way he returned to the auxiliary spacelock. He donned the
spacesuit he had left there and looked at the safety-switch that had been welded closed. He shrugged—no need of opening
the switch to close the door upon it. He'd welded the switch shut so that opening the auxiliary lock hadn't flipped the
warning lamp on the pilot's panel.

</p>
<p>Then the masked man stepped out of the airlock into empty space, kicking himself away from the side of the spacecraft.
At once he became a separate celestial body, and the motion of the ship with regard to his present status was an
acceleration of one gravity, though his velocity was intrinsically that of the spacecraft upon his instant of severance.

</p>
<p>But intrinsic velocity of this nature never harmed a soul and the action as he saw it, was that the ship was stable and
he was falling with Terran constants towards the tail.</p>

<img src="http://unsplash.it/200/500" class="align-left slide-in">

<p>He waited, counting off the minutes by his watch. The spacecraft dwindled and was finally lost in the distance. Yet he
waited, for the first use of his suit-drive would raise a spot on the pilot's celestial sphere, giving warning.

</p>
<p>An hour later he applied the drive on his suit and, using a small direction finder, he located another arriving ship.
Using extreme care, he put himself in the course of the oncomer and applied his suit-drive with extreme caution. He
matched the acceleration of the other ship, matched its course and then, by increments, let the ship catch up with him.

</p>
<p></p>
<p>Eventually it passed him close enough, and he drove himself through the main open spacelock. He slammed the airlock door
and went to the control room. He made a rapid turnover and applied the drive to put as many miles as possible between
himself and the pirated superliner.

Only then did he remove his suit, stow it, and address his interest to the package. It contained a strange crystal. The
crystal was a perfect cube two inches to a side. From face to opposite face it was as transparent as space itself. Even
the surfaces were non-reflecting. Looking through it one derived a sort of tunnel effect, for the surrounding faces were
opaque. Holding it at a distance from the eye and looking though it gave the impression of a two-by-two square tube made
of some metal having zero thickness. A thin square—an optical illusion—marked the boundary of the optical axis.

</p>
<p>He nodded. This was the crystal he sought. He checked one of the opaque pair of faces with a continuity tester and
confirmed his belief. For one axis of the crystal was optical, another axis was a superconductor of electricity. The
third axis was a magnetic axis and was a perfect conductor of magnetic flux. This was harder to check with simple
equipment but the testing of the other two axes gave him sufficient proof.

</p>
<p>He nodded in satisfaction.

</p>
<p></p>
<p>Success!

</p>
<p>Now, give him time to work out his problem, and everything would be just as he had planned. Getting his hands on that
crystal, he felt, was going to be the first step in the success of Jim Forrest. He opened a cabinet door and started to
push things aside to make space for it, when from behind him, a cool voice said:

</p>
<p>"I'll take that!"

</p>
<p>He turned at the voice and his face went through several changes, coming out finally with a stunned look.

</p>
<p>"You were locked in."

</p>
<img src="http://unsplash.it/400/400" class="align-right slide-in">
<p>"Yes?" The girl shrugged. "Well, you were locked out! Now I'll take that crystal!" Her statement was backed up by a
heavy blaster that looked like a semiportable in comparison to her spacegloved hand. The hand was small and the blaster
was heavy but there was no waver to the green-crystal muzzle. It was trained perfectly upon Jim Forrest's belt buckle.

</p>
<p>"Yes? And where will you take it?"

</p>
<p>"None of your business!" she snapped.

</p>
<p>He looked at her suit and shrugged. "Better call for aid," he said, pointing at the space radio. "You'll never make it
in suit-drive."

</p>
<p>"Drivel!" she snorted. "You'll run me near Terra before we part."

</p>
<p>"My dear Ellen Haynes," he said with exaggerated politeness, "may I point out that we are not going to Terra?"

</p>
<p>Ellen laughed nastily, which made it seem worse because it went against the human grain to hear such purely vicious
laughter coming from such an attractive girl.

</p>
<p>"We'll go," she said shortly, "whether you drive or not. I can run this doodlebug too." She waved the blaster
suggestively. "Turn it—or else!"

</p>
<p>"Y'know," he replied, "maybe you'd better drill me. I don't know that I like the idea of chasing all over the solar
system with Ellen Haynes."

</p>
<p>"Turn the ship and get going."

</p>
<p>"No," he said flatly. He stretched and went into a relaxed posture. "We're heading for Ganymede." He looked at
her—stared at her—and smiled slightly. His attitude became almost paternal, as he stepped forward. "You know," he said
quietly, "we both want the same things. We ought to do them together."

</p>
<p>"Not on my life," she said. "And stop right there!"

</p>
<p>"You stole it first," Jim Forrest told her. "Right out from under my hands. I know why. You want to prove the
opticostrictive effects, don't you?"

</p>
<p>"It is my right to try it," she said flatly. "And I'm going to do it my own way!"

</p>
<p>"But I know more about it than you do," he told her gently.

</p>
<p>"I doubt that," she snapped.

</p>
<p></p>
<p>"I've studied it," he said quietly. "I can identify the proper magnetic and electric axes without test. Can you?"

"I can learn," she said sharply. "Now stop—or I'll fire!"

</p>
<p>"You see, when your dad discovered this thing he turned it over to the government. That was the law with any by-product
of the uranium pile. They, however, happened to be working on something else, looking for some definite effect and
couldn't take time off to investigate a crystallographic monstrosity. So it just laid around and grew dust until I—"

</p>
<p>"I know all that," she snapped. "Now...."
